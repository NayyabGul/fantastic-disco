  <h1>Worksheet 1 </h1>
  <p>
    Write a short paragraph (up to 400 words) addressing the following points:
● What is the software development process?
● Why is software design important?
● Give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was designed well
    and explain why.
</p>
  <p>A software development process is a systematic and logical approach to creating a software
    application that facilitates the requirements of its users. It is an intensively structured
    process that transforms aproblem specification or requirement into a functional software 
    application. The initial steps of software development consist of analysis and documentation
    of user requirements and specification of functionality the software should perform. This is 
    followed by a comprehensive design that will act as a blueprint forthe software architecture,
    performance, and user interface. The next step is implementation which includes writing the
    code for the program. The code undergoes extensive testing for bugs or errors before 
    deployment. The final step involves maintaining the software to satisfy the needs of users
    and thrive in a dynamic tech landscape.</p>
  <p>Software design is a significant component in the software development process since 
    it bridges the gap between user requirements and the actual implementation. An effective 
    design creates a strong foundation for the product, ensuring its great performance and user
    experience, as well as increasing the software's scalability with respect to adaptability,
    improvement, and technological advances. Moreover, an effective design enhances traceability,
    reducing rework costs and decreasing development time for the developer.  Software design
    optimizes the architecture of the software, thus improving the performance and overall
    efficiency of the software product.</p>
  <p>One software design that I believe is well designed is “Kindle”, an Amazon e-reader 
    software. Kindle provides its users with a smooth and friendly experience for reading 
    digital books. It has a  simple and intuitive user interface that makes it easier for users
    to search through their e-book collections, as well as download and purchase these titles.
    In addition to the ability to customize their reading space using multiple fonts and styles,
    Kindle also allows users to highlight passages, thus making it extremely popular among 
    readers. Moreover, it seamlessly syncs one's reading progress and notes between multiple 
    devices allowing one to read anytime and anywhere. There are even more features in the 
    application that further adds to its popularity.</p>

  <h1>Worksheet 2 </h1>
  <p>
    Write a short paragraph (up to 200 words) to summarize what is happening in the requirements
    gathering stage and explain why this stage is important for the entire software development 
    process.
Assume you were asked to develop the software product you talked about in Writing Assignment 1
    (Note: In Writing Assignment 1 you were asked to give an example of a software that you
    personally used that you think was designed well and explain why). Write 5 user stories for
    that software. (Recall the user story template: As a <user type>, I want
      <some action/function>, so that <some reason> )
</p>
  <p>The requirement gathering stage is a pivotal process in which the project teams 
    identify and document a  set of operations the software must perform as well as give 
    a clear and concise description of the needs of clients. During this stage, stakeholders
    i.e. clients users and developers get a detailed understanding of the project's objectives.
    The requirement document will act as a checklist for the writers thus it should include 
    requirements that are specific, practical and agreed upon by the team.  Effective 
    requirements will help in categorizing and prioritizing features and prevent unplanned
    additional features to the software, as well as reduce conflicts during their 
    implementation stage. Moreover, by following the right guidelines, the requirements 
    stage ensures that the SDP is functional, reduces the chances of costly changes in the
    future and helps users engage in the project. Finally, comprehensive requirements serve 
    as the foundation upon which the entire software project is built.</p>
  <h2> User Stories </h2>
  <p> As a reader, I want the software to allow me to buy books directly from the app rather
    than purchasing books from Amazon and then uploading it 
      As a parent, I want to set up parental control on certain e-books on my kid's profile,
    so that they can have a safe experience of reading books.
      As a non-native English person, I want to access a built-in dictionary and thesaurus, 
    so that I can have a better understanding of unfamiliar and new wor
      As a user with limited space storage, I would like to archive my books,
    so that I can get rid of the books I have read from my device without losing my purchased books
      As a student, I want the software to allow me to split screen with a multi-task so that 
    I can easily go back and forth between books and have more organized study space.

  <h1>Worksheet 3 </h1>
  <p>
    Write a short paragraph (250-300 words) to address the following. Chapter 3 of the
Subject to Change textbook describes the use (or lack thereof) of empathy in business
models. Describe the elements of empathy as presented in the text, list and describe
the three old-school business models and their problems, and state which one of the
specific elements of empathy each model lacks and why.
In summary,
● Describe the elements of empathy.
● List the three business models and describe their problems.
● Relate an element of empathy to each business model, explain why
the model lacks this element
</p>
  <p>Empathy involves understanding the problems, goals, and tasks of other individuals 
    in a situation without having to experience it yourself. The three elements of Empathy 
    include emotions, culture and context. The emotional element of empathy involves being
    sensitive to the feelings, thoughts and experiences of users and understanding their 
    experiences. Culture and context include understanding how culture influences customers'
    behaviour and how they use the products in different situations and environments. However,
    most of the traditional business model lacked elements of empathy, creating a disconnection 
    with their users. For example, the Sheep Model considered that users were gullible and docile, 
    and would readily accept popular opinions and marketing messages. This model lacked the
    emotional element as companies disappointed customers when the products and statements did 
    not meet the stories that they were told. Then the Homo Economicus  Model viewed human
    behaviour as solely dependent on self-interest and a result of rational decisions that were
    meant to maximize utility. This neglects the cultural and contextual element of empaths as
    it gives an incomplete view of an incomplete picture of customer behaviour and approach to
    the product. Furthermore, the Tasks and Goal Model, solely focuses on improving the usability 
    and efficiency of the products while also assuming users are mere robots, only looking for the
    completion of tasks and goals. This makes the model too low-level to address all aspects of 
    customer experiences as well as neglects the emotional and cultural influences. The main
    problem in all the models was that they oversimplify the complexity of the customer's life.
    The only solution to these problems is to go beyond statistics and extrapolation and 
    understand the experience of users on a more intimate level.</p>

  <h1>Worksheet 5 </h1>
  <p>
    Write a short paragraph (up to 300 words) to explain the concept of prototyping in
software design and its use. Highlight its significance in the development process and
explain why we prototype. List and describe at least three key benefits of using
prototypes in software development. Outline and briefly describe the basic steps
involved in creating and utilizing a paper prototype
</p>
  <p>A prototype is a non-functional mock-up that demonstrates and validates concepts of
    the software development process in less time and cost. It speeds up usability studies 
    and helps to detect problems at an early stage in the design process as well as ensures
    the right way to interact with the product. In fact, it plays an important role in ensuring
    that the user's needs are met. the three benefits of using prototypes in software 
    development include:
    <ul>
      <li>Improved usability; prototyping allows users and clients to interact and be involved
        with the product. This results in receiving valuable feedback and thus ensures that the
        real product meets their need and is user-centred. This improves user satisfiability and usability.</li>
<li>Early issue detection; Prototyping helps to identify and address problems in the design model early 
  in the software development stage. Thus making the process more cost-efficient and less time-consuming. 
  Moreover, changes made early in the design process make it of better quality and allow it to meet the 
  user requirements better.</li>
<li> Improves communication: Act as a communication tool between developers and non-technical stakeholders
  and clients. It helps design teams understand user requirements better and as well as allows further user 
  input, making the product feel more personal to them.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

  <p> One of the common types of prototyping is paper prototyping. It gives us quick feedback, rapid iteration 
    and better communication and improves creativity without any technical skills. In paper prototyping first, 
    the developers have a meeting to discuss typical but significant users and create their personas. Then they
    identify typical tasks and select the important tasks for testing. Screenshots and sketches related to the 
    task are made. Next Usability testing is carried out in the presence of facilitators, human-computer actors,
    and observers, who introduce, manipulate and receive feedback from the users on the prototype, without getting 
    involved in the testing process. Multiple usability tests are conducted for refinement and efficiency.</p>

  <h1>Worksheet 6 </h1>
  <p>
    Write a short paragraph (up to 300 words) on the importance of communication in
software design. Highlight its significance in the development process and briefly
describe at least three key elements of effective communication. Share a personal
experience related to a communication issue you’ve encountered and reflect on how
you could have handled it better given what you have learned in class.
</p>
  <p>Communication plays a significant role in software design, allowing developers to collaborate with stakeholders, 
    clients and other team members effectively.
Communication plays a vital in requirement dage to understanding clients' needs and writing a comprehensive requirement 
    document. Moreover, in the design stage, it allows us to make a collaborative effort to answer the how question, make prototypes run usability studies effectively and write quality design documents.
The key elements of effective communication include:
<ul></ul>
<li>Listening and understanding what are others' perspectives, feedback and requirements. It helps developers create solutions that meet the client's vision.</li>
<li>Ensuring clarity by being honest, positive and fair, can help convey ideas and requirements and make effective decisions. As well as help in making user-centred designs.</li>
<li>Showing empathy, understanding and cultural sensitivity towards your users and team members can help build trust and strong relationships between clients and developers.</li>Showing empathy, understanding and cultural sensitivity towards your users and team members can help build trust and strong relationships between clients and developers.
</ul>
  Effective communication is vital in maintaining a professional work setting and creating successful outcomes and products.
  During my sophomore year in high school, we were tasked with completing a group assignment. Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, our collaboration was limited to online means. The lack of communication within the group led to numerous misunderstandings, which significantly slowed down the progress of our project. After reflecting on my communication class, I realize that I could have facilitated more effective discussions by creating interactive Discord groups where everyone could freely express their perspectives, ideas, and concerns. Thus, we could have improved the project's quality and distributed the workload more evenly among the team members, resulting in a faster turnaround.

  <h1>Worksheet 7 </h1>
  <p>
   Write a short paragraph (up to 300 words) on one of the design principles we discussed
in class last week. Select and state one of the design principles that you want to work
on for your assignment. Define the design principle in your own words and discuss its
importance in the context of software design. Identify and describe two examples of
where you noticed or encountered this principle (it can be in software or any other
domain). Explain how the design principle was used or should have been used to
enhance the user experience.
</p>
  
  <p>Accessibility is a really important principle in software design so that a software product can
    be accessed and used by all users despite their different demographics and abilities. It encompasses 
    operability, simplicity and predictability for a better user experience by creating easily navigable
    interfaces, presenting information clearly and straightforwardly, and providing information in
    multiple modalities. Accessibility means creating interfaces and functionalities that are inclusive
    and accommodating to a wide range of users. 
</p>
  <p>One of the examples of the use of accessibility principles in the software industry is the screen
    reading software which allows users with visual impairment to benefit from the product. It can allow 
    users to navigate websites and applications, read text and interact with digital content, as well as
    facilitate users by providing alternate texts for images and other visual content so that individuals
    with visual impairment can also engage in multimedia content.
</p>
  <p>In addition, the innovation of audiobooks has benefitted people with dyslexia and other learning 
    disabilities. This allows users to listen to the text being read out loud so that users can use
    their auditory strengths to fully understand and enjoy the text of their desired books. This provides 
    an accessible format for individuals who struggle with traditional reading methods, as well as its 
    features like adjustable narration speed, bookmarks, and highlighting also enhance user experience by 
    making it more personal and customized. Audiobooks are a great alternative and inclusive format to 
    eliminate the barriers to reading and allow individuals to fully engage with the content despite their
    disabilities.

</p>
  <p> By ensuring equal access and inclusivity for all users, accessibility promotes a user experience 
    that is welcoming and accommodating to individuals with diverse abilities and disabilities. 
    The benefits of accessibility are far-reaching, as it not only removes barriers and facilitates
    usability but also creates a sense of inclusiveness and equal opportunity.
