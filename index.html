  <h1>Worksheet 1 </h1>
  <p>
    Write a short paragraph (up to 400 words) addressing the following points:
● What is the software development process?
● Why is software design important?
● Give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was designed well
    and explain why.
</p>
  <p>A software development process is a systematic and logical approach to creating a software
    application that facilitates the requirements of its users. It is an intensively structured
    process that transforms aproblem specification or requirement into a functional software 
    application. The initial steps of software development consist of analysis and documentation
    of user requirements and specification of functionality the software should perform. This is 
    followed by a comprehensive design that will act as a blueprint forthe software architecture,
    performance, and user interface. The next step is implementation which includes writing the
    code for the program. The code undergoes extensive testing for bugs or errors before 
    deployment. The final step involves maintaining the software to satisfy the needs of users
    and thrive in a dynamic tech landscape.</p>
  <p>Software design is a significant component in the software development process since 
    it bridges the gap between user requirements and the actual implementation. An effective 
    design creates a strong foundation for the product, ensuring its great performance and user
    experience, as well as increasing the software's scalability with respect to adaptability,
    improvement, and technological advances. Moreover, an effective design enhances traceability,
    reducing rework costs and decreasing development time for the developer.  Software design
    optimizes the architecture of the software, thus improving the performance and overall
    efficiency of the software product.</p>
  <p>One software design that I believe is well designed is “Kindle”, an Amazon e-reader 
    software. Kindle provides its users with a smooth and friendly experience for reading 
    digital books. It has a  simple and intuitive user interface that makes it easier for users
    to search through their e-book collections, as well as download and purchase these titles.
    In addition to the ability to customize their reading space using multiple fonts and styles,
    Kindle also allows users to highlight passages, thus making it extremely popular among 
    readers. Moreover, it seamlessly syncs one's reading progress and notes between multiple 
    devices allowing one to read anytime and anywhere. There are even more features in the 
    application that further adds to its popularity.</p>

  <h1>Worksheet 2 </h1>
  <p>
    Write a short paragraph (up to 200 words) to summarize what is happening in the requirements
    gathering stage and explain why this stage is important for the entire software development 
    process.
Assume you were asked to develop the software product you talked about in Writing Assignment 1
    (Note: In Writing Assignment 1 you were asked to give an example of a software that you
    personally used that you think was designed well and explain why). Write 5 user stories for
    that software. (Recall the user story template: As a <user type>, I want
      <some action/function>, so that <some reason> )
</p>
  <p>The requirement gathering stage is a pivotal process in which the project teams 
    identify and document a  set of operations the software must perform as well as give 
    a clear and concise description of the needs of clients. During this stage, stakeholders
    i.e. clients users and developers get a detailed understanding of the project's objectives.
    The requirement document will act as a checklist for the writers thus it should include 
    requirements that are specific, practical and agreed upon by the team.  Effective 
    requirements will help in categorizing and prioritizing features and prevent unplanned
    additional features to the software, as well as reduce conflicts during their 
    implementation stage. Moreover, by following the right guidelines, the requirements 
    stage ensures that the SDP is functional, reduces the chances of costly changes in the
    future and helps users engage in the project. Finally, comprehensive requirements serve 
    as the foundation upon which the entire software project is built.</p>
  <h2> User Stories </h2>
  <p> As a reader, I want the software to allow me to buy books directly from the app rather
    than purchasing books from Amazon and then uploading it 
      As a parent, I want to set up parental control on certain e-books on my kid's profile,
    so that they can have a safe experience of reading books.
      As a non-native English person, I want to access a built-in dictionary and thesaurus, 
    so that I can have a better understanding of unfamiliar and new wor
      As a user with limited space storage, I would like to archive my books,
    so that I can get rid of the books I have read from my device without losing my purchased books
      As a student, I want the software to allow me to split screen with a multi-task so that 
    I can easily go back and forth between books and have more organized study space.

  <h1>Worksheet 3 </h1>
  <p>
    Write a short paragraph (250-300 words) to address the following. Chapter 3 of the
Subject to Change textbook describes the use (or lack thereof) of empathy in business
models. Describe the elements of empathy as presented in the text, list and describe
the three old-school business models and their problems, and state which one of the
specific elements of empathy each model lacks and why.
In summary,
● Describe the elements of empathy.
● List the three business models and describe their problems.
● Relate an element of empathy to each business model, explain why
the model lacks this element
</p>
  <p>Empathy involves understanding the problems, goals, and tasks of other individuals 
    in a situation without having to experience it yourself. The three elements of Empathy 
    include emotions, culture and context. The emotional element of empathy involves being
    sensitive to the feelings, thoughts and experiences of users and understanding their 
    experiences. Culture and context include understanding how culture influences customers'
    behaviour and how they use the products in different situations and environments. However,
    most of the traditional business model lacked elements of empathy, creating a disconnection 
    with their users. For example, the Sheep Model considered that users were gullible and docile, 
    and would readily accept popular opinions and marketing messages. This model lacked the
    emotional element as companies disappointed customers when the products and statements did 
    not meet the stories that they were told. Then the Homo Economicus  Model viewed human
    behaviour as solely dependent on self-interest and a result of rational decisions that were
    meant to maximize utility. This neglects the cultural and contextual element of empaths as
    it gives an incomplete view of an incomplete picture of customer behaviour and approach to
    the product. Furthermore, the Tasks and Goal Model, solely focuses on improving the usability 
    and efficiency of the products while also assuming users are mere robots, only looking for the
    completion of tasks and goals. This makes the model too low-level to address all aspects of 
    customer experiences as well as neglects the emotional and cultural influences. The main
    problem in all the models was that they oversimplify the complexity of the customer's life.
    The only solution to these problems is to go beyond statistics and extrapolation and 
    understand the experience of users on a more intimate level.</p>
