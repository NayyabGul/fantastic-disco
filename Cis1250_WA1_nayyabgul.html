  <h1>Worksheet 2 </h1>
  <p>
    Write a short paragraph (up to 200 words) to summarize what is happening in the requirements gathering stage and explain why this stage is important for the entire software development process.
Assume you were asked to develop the software product you talked about in Writing Assignment 1 (Note: In Writing Assignment 1 you were asked to give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was designed well and explain why). Write 5 user stories for that software. (Recall the user story template: As a <user type>, I want <some action/function>, so that <some reason> )
</p>
  <p>The requirement gathering stage is a pivotal process in which the project teams identify and document a  set of operations the software must perform as well as give a clear and concise description of the needs of clients. During this stage, stakeholders i.e. clients users and developers get a detailed understanding of the project's objectives. The requirement document will act as a checklist for the writers thus it should include requirements that are specific, practical and agreed upon by the team.  Effective requirements will help in categorizing and prioritizing features and prevent unplanned additional features to the software, as well as reduce conflicts during the implementation stage. Moreover, by following the right guidelines, the requirements stage ensures that the SDP is functional, reduces the chances of costly changes in the future and helps users engage in the project. Finally, comprehensive requirements serve as the foundation upon which the entire software project is built.</p>
