  <h1>Worksheet 3 </h1>
  <p>
    Write a short paragraph (250-300 words) to address the following. Chapter 3 of the
Subject to Change textbook describes the use (or lack thereof) of empathy in business
models. Describe the elements of empathy as presented in the text, list and describe
the three old-school business models and their problems, and state which one of the
specific elements of empathy each model lacks and why.
In summary,
● Describe the elements of empathy.
● List the three business models and describe their problems.
● Relate an element of empathy to each business model, explain why
the model lacks this element

  <p>Empathy involves understanding the problems, goals, and tasks of other individuals 
    in a situation without having to experience it yourself. The three elements of Empathy 
    include emotions, culture and context. The emotional element of empathy involves being
    sensitive to the feelings, thoughts and experiences of users and understanding their 
    experiences. Culture and context include understanding how culture influences customers'
    behaviour and how they use the products in different situations and environments. However,
    most of the traditional business model lacked elements of empathy, creating a disconnection 
    with their users. For example, the Sheep Model considered that users were gullible and docile, 
    and would readily accept popular opinions and marketing messages. This model lacked the
    emotional element as companies disappointed customers when the products and statements did 
    not meet the stories that they were told. Then the Homo Economicus  Model viewed human
    behaviour as solely dependent on self-interest and a result of rational decisions that were
    meant to maximize utility. This neglects the cultural and contextual element of empaths as
    it gives an incomplete view of an incomplete picture of customer behaviour and approach to
    the product. Furthermore, the Tasks and Goal Model, solely focuses on improving the usability 
    and efficiency of the products while also assuming users are mere robots, only looking for the
    completion of tasks and goals. This makes the model too low-level to address all aspects of 
    customer experiences as well as neglects the emotional and cultural influences. The main
    problem in all the models was that they oversimplify the complexity of the customer's life.
    The only solution to these problems is to go beyond statistics and extrapolation and 
    understand the experience of users on a more intimate level.</p>
